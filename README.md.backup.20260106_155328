# Enter The Black Box

A Machine Learning Robustness Lab for Evolving Cyber Attacks

---

## 🧩 Overview
This project was specially created as a **test environment** to demonstrate and evaluate the capabilities of the LazyDeve agent — including project synchronization, file management, code execution, and AI-assisted development workflows.

It serves as both a **functional ML robustness framework** and a **sandbox** for automated AI project control, showing how LazyDeve handles analysis, updates, and integration tasks.
